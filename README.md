# ShowMyHash

ShowMyHash is a simple utility tool that calculates and compares cryptographic hash values for files. It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface built with tkinter and supports various hash algorithms, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512. The utility allows users to compare calculated hash values with manually entered hash values and provides a convenient option to copy the hash values to the clipboard.

## Features

- Calculate hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512) for a selected file.
- Compare calculated hash values with manually entered hash values.
- Copy hash values to the clipboard.
- Integration with the right-click context menu for quick access.
